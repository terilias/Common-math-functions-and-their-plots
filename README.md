# Common math functions and their plots

In this very simple notebook we are using matplotlib to plot some simple, widely used and famous mathematical functions. The main goal is to help us understand better maths and -sometimes- to get a little intuition about some data science algorithms. More functions may be added in this notebook and if you have any suggestion, correction or any comment feel free to contact me or create an issue.  Also please note that some comments in Markdown cells are written in Greek.
